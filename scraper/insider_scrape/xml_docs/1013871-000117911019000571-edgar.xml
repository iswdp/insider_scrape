        <footnote id="F1">On January 6, 2017, Mr. Gaudette was issued 38,619 Restricted Stock Units (&quot;RSUs&quot;) by NRG Energy, Inc. under NRG Energy, Inc.'s Amended and Restated Long Term Incentive Plan. Each RSU is equivalent in value to one share of NRG's Common Stock, par value $.01. On January 6, 2019, 12,860 shares vested. Mr. Gaudette elected to satisfy his tax obligation upon the exchange of common stock for RSUs having a value on the date of the exchange equal to the withholding obligation. This form reflects the surrender of 5,111 shares of common stock to satisfy the grantee's tax withholding obligation.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">In connection with the vesting of the RSUs described above, 128 DERs vested, resulting in the reporting person holding 202 dividend equivalent rights in the aggregate. Dividend equivalent rights accrue on the reporting person's restricted stock units, market stock units or relative performance stock units, which become exercisable proportionately with the restricted stock units, market stock units or relative performance stock units to which they relate and may only be settled in NRG common stock. Each dividend equivalent right is the economic equivalent of one share of NRG common stock.</footnote>
