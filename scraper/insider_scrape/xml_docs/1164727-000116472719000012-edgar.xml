        <footnote id="F1">The sale reported in this Form 4 was effected pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">On December 26, 2018, the reporting person's broker effected a sale pursuant to a previously adopted 10b5-1 plan, which was subsequently reported on Form 4 on December 28, 2018.  Pursuant to the terms of that plan, 14,000 shares should have been sold on that date, however, due to broker error in effecting that transaction, only 3,500 shares were sold.  Upon learning of this error, and without involvement or instruction from the reporting person, the broker engaged in its customary internal procedures to correct the error as of the date dictated by the 10b5-1 plan.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">This transaction was executed in multiple trades at prices ranging from $35.01 to $35.025. The price reported reflects the weighted average sales price. This reporting person undertakes to provide (upon request by the SEC staff, the issuer, or a security holder of the issuer) full information regarding the number of shares sold at each separate price.</footnote>
