        <footnote id="F1">Pursuant to outstanding restricted stock unit award agreements, additional restricted stock units (&quot;RSUs&quot;) are credited to each non-employee director's account on common stock dividend payment dates. The number of RSUs credited is equal to (a) the product of (i) the number of the RSUs in each director's account on the associated dividend record date and (ii) the per share dividend, divided by (b) the closing price on the dividend payment date. On January 15, 2019, Encompass Health paid a dividend on its common stock of $0.27 per share. The transaction reported on this Form 4 is an award of RSUs associated with that dividend payment.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Pursuant to Encompass Health Corporation's Directors Deferred Stock Investment Plan (the &quot;Plan&quot;), cash dividends on shares of Encompass Health common stock held under the Plan are reinvested by the Plan administrator.

The deferred fees fund the purchase of Encompass Health common stock by the Plan administrator in the market for the account of each participating director and such stock is entitled to cash dividends under the Plan. On January 15, 2019, the Company paid a dividend on common stock of $0.27 per share. The transaction reported on this Form 4 is a purchase of shares of common stock of Encompass Health in the market with that dividend payment.</footnote>
