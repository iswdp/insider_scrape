        <footnote id="F5">The vesting of these Performance RSUs is tied to the achievement of a performance goal, which is measured as the total shareholder return, or TSR, realized by the Issuer's stockholders for the two-year performance period from May 1, 2018 to May 1, 2020 versus the TSR realized for that same period by the S&amp;P North American Technology Software Index. The actual number of shares of the Issuer's common stock into which the Performance RSUs will convert will be calculated by multiplying the target number of Performance RSUs (802) by a percentage ranging from 0% to 200% based on the actual level at which the performance goal is attained.
