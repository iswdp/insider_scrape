Each of WndrCo, WC SACD and Parent disclaims beneficial ownership of any shares of Common Stock which may be deemed to be beneficially owned by such person except to the extent of their pecuniary interest therein, and the inclusion of such shares in this Form 4 shall not be deemed an admission of beneficial ownership of all of the reported securities for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act or for any other purpose.</footnote>
