Each Reporting Person may be deemed to be a member of a Section 13(d) group that owns more than 10% of the Issuer's outstanding shares of Common Stock. Each Reporting Person disclaims beneficial ownership of the shares of Common Stock reported herein except to the extent of his or its pecuniary interest therein, and this report shall not be deemed to be an admission that any Reporting Person is the beneficial owner of such shares of Common Stock for purposes of Section 16 or for any other purpose.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">IRS Partners No. 19, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (&quot;IRS 19&quot;), directly owns these shares of common stock (&quot;Common Stock&quot;) of RCM Technologies, Inc. (the &quot;Issuer&quot;). M2O, Inc., a California corporation (&quot;M2O&quot;), is the general partner of IRS 19. The Michael F. O'Connell and Margo L. O'Connell Revocable Trust (the &quot;Trust&quot;) is the sole voting shareholder of M2O and Michael O'Connell, an individual, controls all investment decisions with respect to the Trust. IRS 19, M2O, the Trust and Mr. O'Connell may therefore be deemed to have shared voting and dispositive power over the Common Stock owned by IRS 19.</footnote>

The investment decisions of the Foundation are controlled by Mr. O'Connell (Mr. O'Connell, collectively with IRS 19, the Foundation, M2O and the Trust, the &quot;O'Connell Entities&quot;) and by virtue of such relationship, the Foundation and Mr. O'Connell may be deemed to have shared voting and dispositive power over the Common Stock owned by the Foundation. IRS 19, M2O and the Trust disclaim beneficial ownership of the Common Stock of the Issuer owned by the Foundation except to the extent of their pecuniary interest therein.

IRS 19 and the Foundation have each entered into an investment advisory agreement with Harvest Financial Corporation (&quot;Harvest&quot;), pursuant to which Bradley Vizi (&quot;Mr. Vizi&quot;) on behalf of Harvest, exclusively manages IRS 19's and the Foundation's investment in the Issuer and has certain discretion with respect to purchase and sales of Common Stock of the Issuer. As a result, Harvest and Mr. Vizi may be deemed to have shared dispositive power with respect to the shares held by IRS 19 and the Foundation. Harvest and Mr. Vizi each disclaims beneficial ownership of shares of Common Stock of the Issuer owned by each other except to the extent of his or its pecuniary interest therein.</footnote>
