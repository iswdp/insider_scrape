Yorktown X Associates LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (&quot;Yorktown X Associates&quot;), is the sole general partner of Yorktown X Company LP, the sole general partner of Yorktown X.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Yorktown X Associates disclaims beneficial ownership of these securities except to the extent of its pecuniary interest therein, and this report shall not be deemed an admission that Yorktown X Associates is the beneficial owner of the securities for Section 16 or any other purpose.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">Pursuant to a Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated as of November 20, 2018, by and among the Issuer and other parties thereto (the &quot;Agreement&quot;), Rivercrest Royalties Holdings II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (&quot;Holdings II&quot;), received an equal number of (i) common units representing limited liability company interests (&quot;Opco Common Units&quot;) in Kimbell Royalty Operating, LLC (the &quot;Operating Company&quot;), and (ii) &quot;Class B Units,&quot; which are common units representing limited partner interests of the Issuer, in exchange for the sale by Holdings II of all of the limited liability company interests in Rivercrest Royalties II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F4">(Continued From Footnote 3) Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, Opco Common Units, together with an equal number of Class B Units, are exchangeable on a one-on-one basis for Common Units at the discretion of Holdings II. Also pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, Holdings II is restricted from selling any of its Opco Common Units for a period of 120 days after December 20, 2018, subject to certain limited and specified exceptions.</footnote>
