        <footnote id="F1">For 2019, the reporting person agreed to take 100% of his salary in shares of restricted stock with an eight-year restriction period.  Because the reporting person elected to take his base salary for 2019 in shares of restricted stock, the Company awarded Mr. Wallace additional compensation, in restricted stock, equal to his annual salary.  The price of the securities acquired by the reporting person is based on the average price of the Company's common stock for the 10 trading days immediately preceding January 15, 2019, which was $29.78.  The number of securities issued is equal to the total salary, including the additional compensation, divided by such price.</footnote>
