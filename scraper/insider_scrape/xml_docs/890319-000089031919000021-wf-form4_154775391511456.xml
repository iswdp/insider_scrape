        <footnote id="F1">Under The Taubman Centers, Inc. Non-Employee Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan, each non-employee director may defer the receipt of all or a portion of his or her director retainer (cash and stock) until the earlier of the termination of such director's service on the Company's Board of Directors and upon a change of control. Such deferred compensation is denominated in restricted stock units, and the number of restricted stock units received equals the deferred retainer fee divided by the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the business day immediately before the date the director would otherwise have been entitled to receive the retainer fee. The shares referred to above represent the quarterly retainer fee, which has been deferred in full, and would have otherwise been payable under The Taubman Company LLC 2018 Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">The restricted stock units represent the right to receive equivalent shares of common stock at the end of the deferral period, and each director's account is 100% vested at all times. Therefore, the reporting person has elected to report the deferral as shares of common stock received on the grant date.</footnote>
