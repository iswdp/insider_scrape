        <footnote id="F1">Reporting Person's 2018 long-term incentive compensation award, which was approved by the Compensation and Workplace Practices Committee of the Board on December 11, 2018, was made in the form of AB Holding Units.  Reporting Person therefore may be deemed to have acquired 149,868 AB Holding Units.  These AB Holding Units are held in a rabbi trust under AllianceBernstein's incentive compensation award program until they vest and are delivered to the Reporting Person.  The award vests, subject to various agreements and covenants set forth in the applicable award agreement, in equal annual increments on each of December 1, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022.  The price set forth in the table is the closing price of an AB Holding Unit on December 11, 2018.</footnote>
