        <footnote id="F1">Pursuant to the Company's Independent Director Compensation Policy, the reporting person has been granted a fully vested stock payment award for Company common stock promptly following her appointment as a director of the Company. The number of shares of common stock granted represents the quotient of (A) $95,684.93 (representing the amount of the annual equity award (i.e., $275,000), prorated to reflect the number of days from the date of her appointment to the first anniversary of the most recent annual stockholders meeting), divided by (B) the Company's closing stock price on the date of grant, rounded up to the nearest whole share.</footnote>
    </footnotes>

    <remarks>The reporting person has elected to defer receipt of this fully vested stock payment award under the PayPal Holdings, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan, as amended and restated, to be filed with the registrant's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Fiscal Year Ending 12/31/2018.</remarks>
