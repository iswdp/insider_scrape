        <footnote id="F1">On December 18, 2018, the compensation committee (the &quot;Committee&quot;) of the board of directors of the Issuer considered the potential adverse tax consequences to the Issuer and to certain of the executive officers of the Company, including Mr. Mai (collectively, the &quot;Impacted Officers&quot;), under Sections 280G and 4999 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, as amended, resulting from the treatment of potential payments that may be made pursuant to the Change in Control Agreement between the Issuer and each of the Impacted Officers in connection with the merger contemplated by the Transaction Agreement, dated as of October 7, 2018, between the Issuer and Ensco plc.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">In order to mitigate the potential adverse tax consequences, the Committee has converted all outstanding restricted share units previously awarded to Mr. Mai under the Issuer's Amended and Restated 2013 Rowan Companies plc Incentive Plan (each, a &quot;RSU Award&quot;) to restricted shares (the &quot;Restricted Shares&quot;). Each such Restricted Share will vest in accordance, and subject to, the terms and conditions of the underlying RSU Award from which it was converted.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">In order to satisfy certain tax liabilities of Mr. Mai in connection with his election under Section 83(b) of the Code with respect to the acquisition of the Restricted Shares, the Committee accelerated the vesting of and withheld Restricted Shares with a fair market value equal to the employment and income tax liability imposed on such Restricted Shares.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F4">Sales price is the fair market value on December 18, 2018.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F5">Includes 46,484 Restricted Shares held by the reporting person.</footnote>
