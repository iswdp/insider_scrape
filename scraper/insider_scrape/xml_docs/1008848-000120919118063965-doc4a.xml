        <footnote id="F1">On July 2, 2018, the reporting person filed a Form 4 reporting the June 28, 2018 sale of 5,859 shares of common stock pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. The report person's broker subsequently acknowledged that of the 5,859 shares, 2,085 were erroneously sold by the broker. The sale of the 2,085 shares was unwound through the broker's error account and therefore did not occur for purposes of the reporting person's account. This Form 4 amends and restates, in its entirety, the transaction reported in the July 2, 2018 Form 4 in order to correctly report the disposition of 3,774 shares of the issuer's common stock pursuant to the reporting person's Rule 10b5-1 plan.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">The price reported represents the weighted average sales price of shares sold in multiple transactions at prices ranging from $27.45 to $28.15 per share. The reporting person will provide to the issuer, any security holder of the issuer or the SEC staff, upon request, information regarding the number of shares sold at each price within the range.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">As a result of the overstatement of the number of shares sold on the reporting person's July 2, 2018 Form 4, the reporting person's subsequently filed Form 4s have understated her ownership of the issuer's common stock by 2,085 shares. As of the date of this amendment, the reporting person directly holds 3,653 shares of the issuer's common stock.</footnote>
