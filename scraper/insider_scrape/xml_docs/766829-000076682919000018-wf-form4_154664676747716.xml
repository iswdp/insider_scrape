        <footnote id="F1">Represents 186 shares of common stock withheld of the issuer in satisfaction of the applicable withholding taxes on certain shares of common stock that became issuable on January 3, 2019 pursuant to the terms of the January 3, 2017 Restricted Stock Unit Issuance Agreement between the reporting person and the issuer. The issuable shares were previously reported as Table I securities at the time the restricted stock units were granted, and accordingly the issuance of those shares is not a reportable transaction on this Form 4.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Represents 2,314 shares of the issuer's common stock, 2,500 shares of the issuer's common stock held under a Roth IRA account, 15,883 shares of the issuer's common stock held by Mr. Lynch and his spouse in joint tenancy, and 3,944 shares of the issuer's common stock underlying restricted stock units that will vest and become issuable in accordance with their terms.</footnote>
