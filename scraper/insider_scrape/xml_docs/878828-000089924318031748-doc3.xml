        <footnote id="F1">This Form 3 is filed jointly by Horton Capital Management, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (&quot;HCM&quot;), Horton Capital Partners LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (&quot;HCP&quot;), Horton Capital Partners Fund, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (&quot;HCPF&quot;), and Joseph M. Manko, Jr.  Pursuant to investment management agreements, HCM maintains investment and voting power with respect to 2,091,953 shares of common stock of the issuer held by Horton Capital Partners Fund, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (&quot;HCPF&quot;).  However, despite the delegation of investment and voting power to HCM, HCP may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of such securities under Rule 13d-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, because HCP has the right to acquire investment and voting power through termination of investment management agreements with HCM.  HCM also acts as an investment adviser to certain managed accounts.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">(Continued from from footnote 1) Under investment management agreements with managed account clients, HCM has investment and voting power with respect to 20,000 shares of Common Stock of the issuer held in such managed accounts.  HCP is the general partner of HCPF.  Mr. Manko is the managing member of both HCM and HCP.</footnote>
