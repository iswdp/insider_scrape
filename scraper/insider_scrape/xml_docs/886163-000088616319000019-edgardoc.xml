        <footnote id="F1">Represents the number of shares of common stock issued upon the vesting of performance stock units (PSUs).  Each PSU represented a contingent right to receive one share of the Issuer common stock.  The PSUs were originally granted on 02/11/2016 and were eligible to vest based on the Issuer achievement of certain performance objectives during the three-year performance period ending December 31, 2018.  On January 23, 2019, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Issuer certified the Issuer achievement relative to the applicable performance objectives and approved the vesting of the PSUs with respect to these shares.</footnote>
