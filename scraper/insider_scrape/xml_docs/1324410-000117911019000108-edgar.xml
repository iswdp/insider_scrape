        <footnote id="F1">On January 1, 2019 (the &quot;Effective Date&quot;), pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated as of May 22, 2018, by and between Independent Bank Group, Inc. (&quot;Independent&quot;) and Guaranty Bancorp (&quot;Guaranty&quot;), Guaranty merged with and into Independent (the &quot;Merger&quot;). In connection with the Merger each outstanding share of Guaranty common stock, subject to certain limited exceptions, was converted into the right to receive 0.45 of a share of Independent common stock, with cash payable in lieu of a fractional share in an amount equal to the fraction of a share of Independent common stock which the holder would otherwise be entitled to receive multiplied by $51.92. In connection with the Merger, the reporting person has the right to receive, in exchange for all of the shares of Guaranty common stock reported in Table I, an aggregate of 8,045 shares of Independent common stock, with cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Independent common stock, subject to any required tax</footnote>
