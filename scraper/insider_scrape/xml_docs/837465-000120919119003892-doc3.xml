The Reporting Person may be eligible to vest in up to 200% of such target PSUs during the three year period ending December 31, 2018. To date, the Compensation and Management Succession Committee of the Board of Directors determined that 80% of the target award was deemed to be achieved under the terms of the PSUs as a result of the Company's performance during 2016 - 2017. As a result, 15,051 of the PSUs converted to time-based units that will vest on the third anniversary of the grant date provided the Reporting Person remains employed by Callaway Golf Company through such date. The Reporting Person remains eligible to vest in the remaining PSUs subject to the terms of original award and the achievement of certain performance criteria.</footnote>
