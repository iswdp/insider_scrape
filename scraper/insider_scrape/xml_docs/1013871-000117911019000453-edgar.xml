        <footnote id="F1">Represents Restricted Stock Units issued to the Reporting Person under NRG Energy, Inc.'s Amended and Restated  Long-Term Incentive Plan (&quot;LTIP&quot;).</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Each RSU is equivalent in value to one share of NRG's Common Stock, par value $.01 per share. The Reporting Person will receive from NRG one such share of Common Stock for each RSU that will vest ratably over a three year period beginning on the first anniversary of the date of grant.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">On January 2, 2018, Mr. Gutierrez was issued 59,692 Restricted Stock Units (&quot;RSUs&quot;) by NRG Energy, Inc. under NRG Energy, Inc.'s Amended and Restated Long Term Incentive Plan. Each RSU is equivalent in value to one share of NRG's Common Stock, par value $.01. On January 2, 2019, 19,877 shares vested. Mr. Gutierrez elected to satisfy his tax obligation upon the exchange of common stock for RSUs having a value on the date of the exchange equal to the withholding obligation. This form reflects the surrender of 6,591 shares of common stock to satisfy the grantee's tax withholding obligation.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F4">In connection with the vesting of the RSUs described above, 76 DERs vested, resulting in the reporting person holding 14,771 dividend equivalent rights in the aggregate. Dividend equivalent rights accrue on the reporting person's restricted stock units, market stock units or relative performance stock units, which become exercisable proportionately with the restricted stock units, market stock units or relative performance stock units to which they relate and may only be settled in NRG common stock. Each dividend equivalent right is the economic equivalent of one share of NRG common stock.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F5">The Reporting Person was issued 80,878 Relative Performance Stock Units (&quot;RPSUs&quot;) by NRG Energy, Inc. under the LTIP on January 2, 2019. The RPSUs will convert to shares of NRG Common Stock on January 2, 2022 only in the event the Company has achieved a certain level of total shareholder return (&quot;TSR&quot;) relative to the Peer Group (defined below) over a three-year performance period. The number of shares of Common Stock that the Reporting Person may receive is interpolated for TSR falling between Threshold, Target, and Maximum levels as described below.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F6">Reporting Person will receive (i) a maximum of 161,756 shares of Common Stock if Company's TSR is ranked at or above the 75th percentile relative to a peer group of companies approved by theCompany's Compensation Committee (the &quot;Peer Group&quot;) for the performance period (the &quot;Maximum&quot;); (ii) 80,878 shares of Common Stock if Company's TSR is ranked at the 55th percentile relative to the Peer Group for the performance period (the &quot;Target&quot;); provided, however, if TSR is less than negative fifteen percent (-15%), the Company's TSR must be ranked at the 65th percentile relative to the Peer Group for the performance period to receive the Target award; or (iii) 20,219 shares of Common Stock if Company's TSR is ranked at the 25th percentile relative to the Peer Group for the performance period (the &quot;Threshold&quot;). The Reporting Person will not receive any shares of Common Stock if Company's TSR is below the 25th percentile relative to the Peer Group for the performance period.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F7">The Maximum award that the Reporting Person will receive shall not exceed six (6) times the fair market value of the Target award, determined as of the date of grant.</footnote>
