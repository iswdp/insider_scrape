These sales are mandated by the Issuer's election under its equity incentive plans to require the satisfaction of a tax withholding obligation to be funded by a &quot;sell to cover&quot; transaction and do not represent discretionary trades by the Reporting Person.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">The price reported in Column 4 is a weighted average price. These shares were sold in multiple transactions at prices within the range of $164.8627 to $165.8626, inclusive. The Reporting Person undertakes to provide to Workday, Inc., any security holder of Workday, Inc., or the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission, upon request, full information regarding the number of shares sold at each separate price within the range(s) set forth in this footnote of this Form 4.</footnote>

All grants are subject to the Reporting Person's continued service with Workday on the applicable vesting date.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F4">The reported shares are held by the David A. Duffield Trust dated July 14, 1988, a revocable living trust, of which the Reporting Person is trustee and sole beneficiary, other than the shares underlying the RSUs described in Footnote 3.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F5">Each share of Class B Common Stock is convertible, at any time at the option of the holder, into one (1) share of Class A Common Stock.  In addition, each share of Class B Common Stock will convert automatically into one (1) share of Class A Common Stock upon any transfer, whether or not for value, except for certain permitted transfers described in, and transfers to any &quot;permitted transferee&quot; as defined in, the Issuer's restated certificate of incorporation in effect as of the date hereof.  The shares of Class B Common Stock have no expiration date.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F6">All shares of Class A and Class B Common Stock will convert automatically into shares of a single class of Common Stock upon the earliest to occur of the following: (a) upon the election by the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, (b) the date when the number of outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock represents less than 9% of all outstanding shares of Class A and Class B Common Stock, (c) October 11, 2032 or (d) nine (9) months after the death of the later to die of David A.
