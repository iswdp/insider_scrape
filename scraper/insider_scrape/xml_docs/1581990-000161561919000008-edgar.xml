(&quot;PAGP&quot;) and Plains All American GP LLC (&quot;GP LLC&quot;), has the right, from time to time, to cause AAP to redeem and cancel such partner's AAP Class A units in exchange for the distribution of an equal number of common units representing limited partner interests (&quot;Common Units&quot;) of Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (&quot;PAA&quot;) held by AAP (the &quot;Redemption Right&quot;).  In connection with the exercise of a Redemption Right, such limited partner must also surrender to PAGP an equal number of Class B shares of PAGP and Company Units of PAA GP Holdings LLC (&quot;PAGP GP&quot;).</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">On January 23, 2019, a limited partner of AAP exercised the Redemption Right with respect to an aggregate of 66,185  AAP Class A units, resulting in the cancellation of such AAP Class A units and the distribution of 66,185 Common Units from AAP to the redeeming partner.</footnote>
