        <footnote id="F1">Each performance share unit represents the Company's commitment to issue one share of Boston Scientific common stock.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">On February 22, 2016, the reporting person was awarded a target number of performance share units under the Company's 2016 Free Cash Flow Performance Share Program, the actual number of which is to be earned by the reporting person based on the Company's 2016 adjusted free cash flow measured against its 2016 financial plan over the one-year performance period ending December 31, 2016 and subject to the completion of a three-year individual service period (inclusive of the performance period). On February 28, 2017, the number of the target performance share units as to which the performance criteria had been satisfied was determined. The performance share units so determined will vest in whole upon the completion of the individual service period that ends on December 31, 2018.</footnote>
    </footnotes>

    <remarks>On March 6, 2017, the reporting person filed a Form 4 reporting in Table II the grant of performance share units which mistakenly reports grant date and number of shares.  This Form 4 corrects the details of that grant of performance share units.</remarks>
