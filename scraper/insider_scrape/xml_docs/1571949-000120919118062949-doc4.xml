        <footnote id="F1">Represents shares of restricted stock issued to the filing person on December 13, 2017. The restricted stock units vest over three years (1/3 on December 13, 2018, 1/3 on December 13, 2019 and 1/3 on December 13, 2020). Of the 4,256 shares, 1,418 shares were issued on December 13, 2018, of which 644 shares were withheld to satisfy payment of the Issuer's tax withholding obligation. The remaining 2,838 shares are scheduled to be issued on December 13, 2019 and December 13, 2020 and taxes for these issuances will be withheld and reported at the time of vesting.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">The common stock number referred in Table I is an aggregate number and represents 43,365 shares of common stock and 6,313 unvested restricted stock units (&quot;RSUs&quot;), and 16,043 unvested performance based restricted stock units (&quot;PSU's&quot;), for which the performance period has been satisfied.
