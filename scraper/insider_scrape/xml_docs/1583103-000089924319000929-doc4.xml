        <footnote id="F1">Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of October 18, 2018 (the &quot;Merger Agreement&quot;), by and among Valero Energy Corporation (&quot;VLO&quot;), Forest Merger Sub, LLC (&quot;Merger Sub&quot;), Valero Energy Partners LP (the &quot;Issuer&quot;) and Valero Energy Partners GP LLC, the Merger Sub merged with and into the Issuer (the &quot;Merger&quot;), with the Issuer surviving the Merger and continuing to exist as a Delaware limited partnership. At the effective time of the Merger (the &quot;Effective Time&quot;), each common unit representing a limited partner interest in the Issuer (the &quot;Common Units&quot;), other than Common Units owned by VLO and its subsidiaries, was converted into the right to receive $42.25 per Common Unit in cash without any interest thereon (the &quot;Merger Consideration&quot;) and all such Common Units were automatically cancelled and ceased to exist.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">(Continued from Footnote 1) Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, immediately prior to the Effective Time, the restricted units (&quot;Restricted Units&quot;) granted under the Valero Energy Partners LP 2013 Incentive Compensation Plan that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time received immediate and full acceleration of vesting and the distribution equivalent rights associated with such Restricted Units were cancelled and ceased to exist. At the Effective Time, each vested Restricted Unit became entitled to receive the Merger Consideration.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">Following the Effective Time of the Merger, the Reporting Person no longer owns, directly or indirectly, any Common Units.</footnote>
