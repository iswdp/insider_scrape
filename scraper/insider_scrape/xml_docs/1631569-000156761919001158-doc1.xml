        <footnote id="F1">For 2019, the reporting person agreed to take 100% of her salary in the form of shares of restricted stock with an eight-year restriction period. Because the reporting person elected to take her base salary for 2019 in these shares of restricted stock, the Company awarded Ms. Stach additional compensation, in restricted stock, equal to her annual salary. The price of the securities acquired by the reporting person is based on the average price of the Company's common stock for the 10 trading days immediately preceding January 15, 2019, which was $29.78. The number of securities issued is equal to the total salary, including the additional compensation, divided by such price.</footnote>
