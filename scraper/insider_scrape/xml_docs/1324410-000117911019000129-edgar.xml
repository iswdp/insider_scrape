        <footnote id="F2">In connection with the Merger shares of performance-based restricted stock previously granted to the reporting person under the Guaranty Bancorp 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan converted into shares of time-based restricted stock pursuant to the terms of the plan scheduled to vest in accordance with the original performance cycle.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">In connection with the Merger each share of Guaranty common stock and each unvested share of time-based restricted stock granted to the reporting person was converted into the right to receive 0.45 of a share of Independent common stock and restricted stock, respectively, with cash payable in lieu of a fractional share in an amount equal to the fraction of a share of Independent common stock which the holder would otherwise be entitled to receive multiplied by $51.92.
