        <footnote id="F1">Represents 389 shares of common stock withheld of the issuer in satisfaction of the applicable withholding taxes on certain shares of common stock that became issuable on January 4, 2019 pursuant to the terms of the January 4, 2016 Restricted Stock Issuance Agreement between the issuer and the reporting person. The issuable shares were previously reported as Table I securities at the time the restricted stock units were granted, and accordingly the issuance of those shares is not a reportable transaction on this Form 4.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Represents 9,795 shares of the issuer's common stock and 2,571 shares of the issuer's common stock underlying restricted stock units that will vest and become issuable in accordance with their terms.</footnote>
