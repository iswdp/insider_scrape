        <footnote id="F1">The Class B common stock does not carry economic value beyond the right to receive the par value of such stock upon liquidation, dissolution or exchange of those shares. However, the Class B common stock entitles its holder to ten votes per share on every matter submitted to the Issuer's stockholders for a vote.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Upon termination of the 2008 Grantor Retained Annuity Trust of Mario Giannini, half of the trust's holdings were transferred to the reporting person as beneficiary, including 363,648 shares of Class B common stock and 363,648 Class B Units. On December 13, 2018, the reporting person became a member of a group that beneficially owns more than 10% of the Issuer's Class A common stock.</footnote>
