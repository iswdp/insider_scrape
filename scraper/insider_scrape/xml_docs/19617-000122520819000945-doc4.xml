        <footnote id="F1">Consistent with last year, Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) represent 50% of Mr. Pinto's incentive compensation for performance year 2018, with the remaining 50% awarded in the form of Performance Share Units (PSUs). Also consistent with last year, Mr. Pinto did not receive variable compensation in the form of cash. Mr. Pinto is designated as Identified Staff subject to the minimum compensation structure of the European Union's Capital Requirements Directive IV (CRD IV) and receives a fixed cash allowance in addition to base salary.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Each RSU represents a contingent right to receive one share of JPMC common stock. For the purposes of determining the number of RSUs and PSUs granted to Mr. Pinto, the Firm has established a grant date fair value per unit that takes into account that these awards do not carry the right to dividends or dividend equivalents prior to vesting, in accordance with local regulations.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">Equity incentives are subject to the JPMorgan Chase Bonus Recoupment Policy which applies in the event of a material restatement of the Firm's financials. In addition, all equity awards granted in 2019 contain recapture provisions that enable the Firm to cancel an unvested or un-exercisable award and/or recover the value of certain stock distributed under the award in specified circumstances. In addition to recapture provisions, portions of equity awards awarded to Operating Committee members are also subject to additional Protection-based Vesting provisions under which awards may be cancelled, any determination with respect to which is subject to ratification by the Compensation &amp; Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors. Furthermore, Mr. Pinto's equity incentives are subject to additional recapture provisions as apply to the Firm's relevant U.K. regulated CRD IV Identified Staff.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F4">RSUs vest 20% on each of the following dates: January 13, 2022, January 13, 2023, January 13, 2024, January 13, 2025, and January 13, 2026. The shares resulting from vesting are subject to a hold for 12 months from vesting date.</footnote>
