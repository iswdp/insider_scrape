As a result of the foregoing transaction, BSREP II owns 11,767,677.78 Class C Units (adjusted by .01 unit due to rounding).</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">This Form 4 is being jointly filed by and on behalf of each of the following persons (each, a &quot;Reporting Person&quot;): (i) Brookfield Asset Management Inc., a corporation formed under the laws of Ontario, Canada (&quot;BAM&quot;); (ii) Partners Limited, a corporation formed under the laws of Ontario, Canada (&quot;Partners Limited&quot;); (iii) Brookfield Holdings Canada Inc., a corporation formed under the laws of Ontario, Canada (&quot;BHC&quot;); (iv) Brookfield US Holdings Inc., a corporation formed under the laws of Ontario, Canada (&quot;BUSHI&quot;); (v) Brookfield US Corporation, a Delaware corporation (&quot;BUSC&quot;); (vi) BUSC Finance LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (&quot;BUSC Finance&quot;); (vii) Brookfield Property Master Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (&quot;BPMH&quot;); (continued in footnote 3)</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">(continued from footnote 2) (viii) Brookfield Property Group LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (&quot;BPG&quot;); (ix) Brookfield Strategic Real Estate Partners II GP OF GP LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (&quot;BSREP II GP of GP&quot;); (x) Brookfield Strategic Real Estate Partners II GP L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (&quot;BSREP II GP&quot;); and (xi) BSREP II, which directly holds 11,767,677.78 Class C Units of OpCo (adjusted by .01 unit due to rounding) and owns 14,786 shares of the Issuer's common stock, par value $0.01 (the &quot;Common Stock&quot;), 7,210 shares of which are subject to forfeiture in respect of Lowell Baron's and Bruce Wiles's service as directors of the Issuer, through its wholly owned subsidiary BSREP II Hospitality II Board LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. (continued in footnote 4)</footnote>
        <footnote id="F4">(continued from footnote 3) On or about January 3, 2019, pursuant to an internal reorganization, BUSC is expected to merge with and into Brookfield Special Opportunities Inc., a Delaware corporation, with Brookfield Special Opportunities Inc. surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of BUSHI and the direct parent company of BUSC Finance.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F5">Each of the Reporting Persons may be deemed to beneficially own the securities of the Issuer beneficially owned by the Reporting Persons directly or indirectly controlled by it, but each disclaims beneficial ownership of such securities, except to the extent of such Reporting Person's pecuniary interest therein. The filing of this statement shall not be deemed to be an admission that, for purposes of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise, the Reporting Persons are the beneficial owners of any securities reported herein.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F6">Class C Units of OpCo generally are convertible into units of limited partnership interests in OpCo entitled &quot;OP Units&quot; (&quot;OP Units&quot;) at any time at the option of BSREP II at an initial conversion price of $14.75, subject to customary antidilution adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events and transactions. OP Units, in turn, generally are redeemable for shares of the Issuer's Common Stock on a one-for-one-basis or the cash value of a corresponding number of shares of Common Stock, at the election of the Issuer, in accordance with the terms of the Amended &amp; Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of OpCo. Neither the Class C Units nor OP Units has an expiration date.</footnote>
    </footnotes>

    <remarks>(7) The Reporting Persons are jointly filing this Form 4 pursuant to Rule 16a-3(j) under the Exchange Act.
(8) Because no more than 10 reporting persons can file any one Form 4 through the Securities and Exchange Commission's EDGAR system, BPMH has jointly filed with the Reporting Persons on a separate Form 4 filing submitted on the same day hereof.</remarks>
