        <footnote id="F1">Pursuant to an exchange agreement among the Issuer and certain common unit holders of Carvana Group, LLC, dated April 27, 2017 (the &quot;Exchange Agreement&quot;), holders of Class A common units of Carvana Group, LLC (&quot;Class A Units&quot;) are permitted to exchange their Class A Units for shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Issuer (the &quot;Class A Common Stock&quot;) at a rate of four shares of Class A Common Stock for every five Class A Units being exchanged, or at the Issuer's election, for cash equal to the value of a share of Class A Common Stock multiplied by 0.8 times the number of Class A Units being exchanged. Additionally, to the extent such holders of Class A Units also hold Class B common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Issuer (the &quot;Class B Common Stock&quot;), they are required to deliver to the Issuer a number of shares of Class B Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Class A Common Stock for which the Class A Units are being exchanged.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">These shares of Class B Common Stock were cancelled for no consideration upon the exchange of the Class A Units for shares of Class A Common Stock of the Issuer.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">The Form 4 filed by the Reporting Person on May 2, 2018 inadvertently overstated the number of shares of Class B Common Stock beneficially owned by the Reporting Person by 133,826 shares in Column 5 of Table I.  This amendment is being filed to correct the number of shares reported in Column 5 of Table I.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F4">These shares of Class B Common Stock are owned directly by GV Auto I, LLC (&quot;GV Auto&quot;), an entity in which the Reporting Person is a member, and represent the Reporting Person's pro rata membership interest in GV Auto.  The Reporting Person no longer has a reportable beneficial interest in any shares owned by his eldest son, which were included in the Reporting Person's prior ownership reports.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F5">On April 30, 2018, the Reporting Person exchanged 68,750 Class A Units for 55,000 shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Exchange Agreement. The Reporting Person immediately sold the 55,000 shares of Class A Common Stock acquired upon conversion of the Class A Units in an underwritten public offering pursuant to the Issuer's Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-224404).</footnote>
        <footnote id="F6">The Class A Units have no expiration date.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F7">The Form 4 filed by the Reporting Person on May 2, 2018 inadvertently overstated the number of shares of Class A Units beneficially owned by the Reporting Person by 167,283 units in Column 9 of Table II.  This amendment is being filed to correct the number of units reported in Column 9 of Table II.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F8">These Class A Units are owned directly by GV Auto, an entity in which the Reporting Person is a member, and represent the Reporting Person's pro rata membership interest in GV Auto.  The Reporting Person no longer has a reportable beneficial interest in any units owned by his eldest son, which were included in the Reporting Person's prior ownership reports.</footnote>
