        <footnote id="F1">On January 2, 2019, the reporting person elected to receive a grant of Series 2019B restricted limited partnership interests (&quot;Restricted Units&quot;) in ERP Operating Limited Partnership (the &quot;Operating Partnership&quot;), the operating partnership of Equity Residential (the &quot;Company&quot;), in connection with the Company's annual grant of long-term compensation for prospective service from the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders to the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, prorated to reflect service beginning January 1, 2019.  Restricted Units are a class of partnership interest that automatically convert into an equal number of limited partnership interests of the Operating Partnership (&quot;OP Units&quot;) when the capital account related to the Restricted Units reaches a specified target for federal income tax purposes (provided such target is reached within ten years of issuance).  Subject to the vesting requirements of the grant and certain other restrictions, OP Units are exchangeable by the holder for common shares of the Company on a one-for-one basis or the cash value of such shares, at the Company's option.  The Restricted Units reflected in this report also include any OP Units into which such Restricted Units automatically convert.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">The Restricted Units are scheduled to vest on January 2, 2020.  In addition, the Restricted Units (including any OP Units into which they may automatically convert) are subject to a holding restriction until January 2, 2021.</footnote>
