        <footnote id="F1">The stock unit award was granted pursuant to the Vectren Corporation At Risk Compensation Plan (Plan) and is subject to the terms, provisions and conditions of the Plan and Plan grant agreement. The lifting of restrictions and forfeiture provisions are dependent upon continued service by the grantee until January 1, 2020, except as described in the Plan and the Plan grant agreement. If the service of the grantee ends at the annual shareholder meeting, the stock unit award will vest at such time and will be prorated based upon the number of days served.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">The grantee will be paid for each stock unit, in cash, the value of one share of Vectren's common stock on the date restrictions lapse, provided grantee is in compliance with the share ownership guidelines established by the company. If the grantee is not then in compliance with the company's share ownership guidelines, the value of each stock unit will be paid to the grantee in one unrestricted share of Vectren's common stock. This acquisition was approved in accordance with Rule 16b-3.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">If the closing date of the previously announced merger transaction between Vectren Corporation and CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (CNP) occurs prior to January 1, 2020, then the Stock Unit Awards shall be cancelled and converted into a vested right to receive cash in an amount equal to (i) $72.00 multiplied by (ii) the number of Stock Unit Awards provided hereunder multiplied by (iii) a fraction with a numerator equal to the number of days in the period beginning on the Grant Date and ending on the closing date of the transaction with CNP and a denominator equal to 365, but in no event shall such fraction be greater than one.</footnote>
