        <footnote id="F1">In addition to the shares of Common Stock and Performance Share Units reported on this Form 4, which total 1,281,177 shares, Mr. Conroy also holds, in the aggregate, an additional 1,177,508 vested and unvested options to purchase shares of Common Stock and restricted stock units, with each restricted stock unit representing a contingent right to receive one share of Common Stock.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Represents a PSU award granted on February 26, 2016 (the &quot;PSU Award&quot;) which covered a three-year performance measurement period ending on December 31, 2018 (the &quot;Performance Period&quot;) and was described in the Company's proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 28, 2017.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">Each Performance Share Unit represents a right to receive one share of common stock.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F4">The PSU Award was subject to certain performance-based vesting requirements tied to the growth in the Company's stock price through the end of the Performance Period as calculated by reference to the 20 trading day trailing average closing price of the Company's common stock (the &quot;Stock Price&quot;) as of the last day of the Performance Period compared to such Stock Price as of the beginning of the Performance Period.  The Stock Price as of the last day of the Performance Period was $67.25 representing a greater than 760% increase from the $8.85 Stock Price at the beginning of the Performance Period.  At target, the PSU Award covered 202,931 PSUs. Because the Stock Price at the end of the Performance Period well exceeded the maximum target Stock Price, the reporting person earned the maximum number of PSUs to which he was entitled under the PSU Award. The PSUs are immediately vested and will settle into shares of Common Stock within 30 days from the date of issuance.</footnote>
