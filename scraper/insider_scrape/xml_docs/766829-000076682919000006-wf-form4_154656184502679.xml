Each RSU entitles the reporting person to receive one share of common stock upon vesting of the RSU. The RSUs will vest in three annual successive installments upon the completion of the reporting person's each year of service with the issuer for the three-year period measured from the date of grant, subject to accelerated vesting under certain prescribed circumstances.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Represents 13,249 shares of the issuer's common stock and 4,650 shares of the issuer's common stock underlying restricted stock units that will vest and become issuable in accordance with their terms.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">Represents 174 shares of common stock withheld of the issuer in satisfaction of the applicable withholding taxes on certain shares of common stock that became issuable on January 2, 2019 pursuant to the terms of the January 2, 2018 Restricted Stock Unit Issuance Agreement between the reporting person and the issuer. The issuable shares were previously reported as Table I securities at the time the Restricted Stock Units were granted and accordingly the issuance of those shares is not a reportable transaction on this Form 4.</footnote>
