        <footnote id="F1">These Common Shares are directly beneficially owned by Roivant Sciences Ltd. (&quot;Roivant&quot;). Pursuant to Roivant's internal governance documents, following the appointment to Roivant's board of directors of one or more directors meeting certain independence criteria (each an &quot;Independent Director&quot; and collectively the &quot;Independent Directors&quot;), dispositions of the Common Shares require the approval of a majority of Roivant's board of directors, including (i) at least two Independent Directors, or, (ii) if there is only one independent director, that sole Independent Director. The reporting person was appointed as an Independent Director of Roivant effective October 18, 2016.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">As the approval of the reporting person as an Independent Director, and, to the extent one other Independent Director is serving, that other Independent Director, is needed for Roivant to dispose of the Common Shares, the reporting person may be deemed to have dispositive power over, and to be an indirect beneficial owner of, the Common Shares directly beneficially owned by Roivant. The reporting person disclaims beneficial ownership of the shares owned by Roivant, except to the extent of his respective pecuniary interest therein. Additionally, this filing shall not be deemed an admission that the reporting person and any other Independent Director constitute a &quot;group&quot; for purposes of Section 13(d) or Section 13(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.</footnote>
