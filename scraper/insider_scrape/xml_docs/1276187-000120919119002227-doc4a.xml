        <footnote id="F1">Acquisition in connection with the merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of Energy Transfer Equity, L.P. (&quot;ETE&quot;) with Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. (&quot;ETP&quot;), with ETP continuing as the surviving entity and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of ETE (the &quot;Merger&quot;). On October 18, 2018, the last trading day for the ETP common units, the closing price of ETP's common units was $21.47 per unit and the closing price of ETE's common units was $16.82 per unit. Each ETP common unit outstanding was converted into the right to receive 1.28 ETE common units. As part of the Merger, ETE changed its name to &quot;Energy Transfer LP&quot; and its common units began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (&quot;NYSE&quot;) under the &quot;ET&quot; ticker symbol when the market opened on Friday, October 19, 2018.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">This amendment is being filed to correct the Form of Ownership previously report as Direct.  These units are held Indirectly by the Steven R. Anderson Revocable Trust.</footnote>
