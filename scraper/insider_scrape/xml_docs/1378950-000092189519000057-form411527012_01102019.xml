        <footnote id="F1">This Form 4 is filed jointly by David Kanen, Kanen Wealth Management, LLC (&quot;KWM&quot;) and the Philotimo Fund, LP (collectively, the &quot;Reporting Persons&quot;). Each of the Reporting Persons may be deemed to be a member of a group that may be deemed to collectively beneficially own more than 10% of the Issuer's outstanding shares of Common Stock. The filing of this Form 4 shall not be deemed an admission that the Reporting Persons are, for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the beneficial owners of any securities of the Issuer he or it does not directly own.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Mr. Kanen beneficially owns, pursuant to the beneficial ownership rules of Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &quot;Exchange Act&quot;), 4,981,624 shares of Common Stock, which represent approximately 14.2% of the Issuer's outstanding shares of Common Stock.
