        <footnote id="F2">Amount no longer includes 20,000 performance-based RSUs awarded to Mr. Morrison on December 1, 2017, which did not vest.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">Pursuant to the terms of restricted stock unit (&quot;RSU&quot;) grant agreements, the vesting of certain RSUs was accelerated in connection with the Merger and such RSUs became fully vested effective immediately prior to the effective time of the merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the &quot;Merger&quot;). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, each such vested RSU was cancelled in the Merger and, in lieu of any issuance of shares in settlement of such RSU, converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to $13.10 per share (without interest and less any applicable tax withholding).</footnote>
        <footnote id="F4">Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, unvested RSUs were cancelled at the effective time of the Merger and converted into a substitute right to receive a cash payment equal to $13.10 per share (without interest and less any applicable tax withholding) to be paid by Altair only if such conditions to vesting of the RSUs are satisfied prior to the vesting date of the RSUs; provided that if the reporting person's employment is terminated by the surviving corporation of the Merger or its affiliates prior to the vesting date under conditions that would have accelerated the vesting of such RSUs had the RSUs remained outstanding, then such vesting shall be accelerated as of the date of the termination of the reporting person's employment.</footnote>

The reporting person disclaims beneficial ownership of these securities, and this report shall not be deemed an admission that the reporting person is the beneficial owner of the securities for purposes of Section 16 or for any other purpose.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F8">This amount includes 192 shares owned by Mr. Morrison's children held in UTMA accounts which were previously reported as separate holdings.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F9">Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, each vested stock option of the Company that is outstanding and vested was cancelled in exchange for a payment in cash equal to the product of (i) the total amount of Common Stock of the Company subject to such vested stock option immediately prior to such cancellation and (ii) the excess, if any, of $13.10 over the exercise price per share of Common Stock subject to such vested stock option immediately prior to such cancellation.</footnote>
