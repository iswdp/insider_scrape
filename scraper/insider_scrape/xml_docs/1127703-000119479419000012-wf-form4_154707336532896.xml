        <footnote id="F1">These shares were acquired from ProAssurance Corporation under its Director Deferred Stock Compensation Plan (the &quot;Plan&quot;) and are exempt under Rule 16b-3. The Board of Directors may grant shares to directors at each annual meeting as part of their compensation and directors may elect to defer payment of the shares under the Plan. Any deferred shares are then credited to the electing director's account under the Plan, and accrue dividends as permitted by the Plan. On each subsequent dividend payment date, the accrued dividends are credited to the directors' deferred stock accounts as additional whole shares of deferred stock at the market price on the dividend payment date. Amounts attributable to fractional shares are denominated in dollars and applied toward additional shares of deferred stock on the next dividend payment date. Deferred stock will be paid solely in our shares of stock when the deferred stock is payable to the directors.</footnote>
