        <footnote id="F1">Exempt transaction pursuant to Section 16b-3(e) - payment of exercise price or tax liability by delivering or withholding securities incident to the receipt, exercise or vesting of a security issued in accordance with Rule 16b-3. All of the shares reported as disposed of on this Form 4 were relinquished by the Reporting Person and cancelled by the Issuer in exchange for the Issuer's agreement to pay federal and state tax withholding obligations of the Reporting Person resulting from the vesting of restricted stock units (&quot;RSUs&quot;). The Reporting Person did not sell or otherwise dispose of any of the shares reported on this Form 4 for any reason other than to cover required taxes.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Includes 13,642 shares subject to an award of RSUs, of which 25% of the total RSUs vested on January 1, 2019, and 25% will vest on each anniversary thereafter, subject to the status of &quot;Participant's Service&quot; (as defined in the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan) through each vesting date. Each RSU represents a contingent right to receive one share of the Issuer's Class A Common Stock upon settlement for no consideration. Shares of the Issuer's Class A Common Stock will be delivered to the Reporting Person following vesting.</footnote>
