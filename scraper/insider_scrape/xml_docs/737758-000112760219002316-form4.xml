        <footnote id="F1">Represents the payout of 1,670 shares of common stock and 97.974 related dividend reinvestment shares in connection with an annual common stock award for service as a non-employee director issued under The Toro Company 2010 Equity and Incentive Plan, as amended. The reporting person previously deferred the payout of her common stock award under The Toro Company Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the &quot;Deferred Plan&quot;) and, accordingly, the reporting person's annual common stock award was initially paid in common stock units under the Deferred Plan. A common stock unit under the Deferred Plan is the economic equivalent of one share of Toro common stock. The reporting person previously elected to receive a single lump sum distribution, payable in January 2019 under the terms of the Deferred Plan, and, therefore, the common stock units were settled for shares of Toro common stock.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Includes 18.697 common stock units acquired by the reporting person under the dividend reinvestment feature of the Deferred Plan since the date of her last report.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">Includes 7.195 shares of common stock acquired by the reporting person since the date of her last report under the dividend reinvestment feature of The Toro Company Direct Stock Purchase Plan.</footnote>
