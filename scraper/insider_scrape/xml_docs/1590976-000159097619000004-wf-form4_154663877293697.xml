        <footnote id="F2">The stock units are fully vested and payable in an equivalent number of shares of the Issuer's Class A Common Stock upon or as soon as practicable, and in all events within 30 days, following the first to occur of (A) the date of the reporting person's separation from service (as defined in the Policy) or (B) the occurrence of a change in control under the Issuer's Long-Term Incentive Plan.</footnote>
