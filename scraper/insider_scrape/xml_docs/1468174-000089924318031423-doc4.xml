        <footnote id="F1">As provided in the Issuer's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, each share of Class B Common Stock is convertible at any time, at the option of the holder, into one share of Class A Common Stock.  In addition, each share of Class B Common Stock will convert automatically into one share of Class A Common Stock upon any transfer, whether or not for value, except for certain permitted transfers described in the Issuer's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">On December 18, 2018, the Reporting Person transferred 11,685 shares of Class B Common Stock to DGC 2018 Trust.  No consideration was paid in connection with the transfer.  The transfer of shares of Class B Common Stock by the Reporting Person constitutes a &quot;permitted transfer&quot; as defined under the Issuer's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.  Accordingly, immediately following the transfer, the shares remain shares of Class B Common Stock.</footnote>
