        <footnote id="F1">This amendment is being filed to correct an administrative error on the reporting person's original Form 4 filed November 13, 2018 (&quot;Original Form 4&quot;). The number of shares purchased by the reporting person on November 8, 2018 and reported on the Original Form 4 was correctly stated as 10,000 shares; however, the number of shares reported as being beneficially owned by the reporting person following the transaction was inadvertently overstated by 10,000 shares and has been corrected in this amended Form 4. In addition, due to an administrative rounding error following the Company's 3-to-1 reverse stock split, which occurred on May 9, 2018, the Form 4 filed for the reporting person on June 8, 2018 inadvertently overstated the amount of shares beneficially owned by the reporting person following the transaction by 1 share, which error has also been corrected on this amended Form 4.</footnote>
