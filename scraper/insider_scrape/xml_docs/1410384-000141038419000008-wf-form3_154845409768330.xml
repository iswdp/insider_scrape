        <footnote id="F1">Represents a grant of performance-based restricted stock units (&quot;Units&quot;) under the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan. The target number of Units is presented in the table (&quot;Target Amount&quot;). Subject to continued employment, one-third (1/3) of the Target Amount is scheduled to vest annually (&quot;Scheduled Amount&quot;), on or about July 2 of each of 2019, 2020 and 2021. In each of the first two years the number of Units that actually vests will be 0% to 100% of the Scheduled Amount, and in the third year the number of Units that actually will vest will be 0% to 200% of the Target Amount, less the amount of any vesting in the first two years, in each case depending upon the performance of Q2 Holdings, Inc.'s common stock price as compared to the Russell 2000 Index, as more specifically set forth in the grant agreement. The maximum number of Units that may vest over three years is 200% of the Target Amount. Vested Units will be paid in an equal number of shares of Q2 Holdings, Inc. common stock.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Shares of stock acquired represent shares underlying Restricted Stock Units. The Restricted Stock Units vest annually in four equal installments beginning June 9, 2019.</footnote>
