(&quot;Parent&quot;) were wholly owned subsidiaries of WC SACD, formed for the purpose of entering into the definitive merger agreement with the Company. Because of the relationship of WC SACD and iSubscribed Inc., each of the Reporting Persons may be deemed to beneficially own the shares of common stock (&quot;Common Stock&quot;) of Intersections Inc. (the &quot;Company&quot;) beneficially owned by Parent. Mr. Ravichandran was the Chief Executive Officer and a director of iSubscribed Inc. at the time of the transactions.  Parent may be deemed to indirectly beneficially own the shares of Common Stock of the Company beneficially owned by Merger Sub.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">(Continued from Footnote 1) The Reporting Persons disclaim beneficial ownership of such shares of Common Stock except to the extent of their pecuniary interest therein, and the inclusion of such shares in this Form 4 shall not be deemed an admission of beneficial ownership of all of the reported securities for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act or for any other purpose.</footnote>

Subsequently on January 11, 2019, WC SACD Holdings, Inc., an affiliate of WC SACD, acquired iSubscribed Inc. pursuant to a merger.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F4">On January 11, 2019, immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, the outstanding principal balance of the senior convertible note held by Parent (the &quot;Parent Note&quot;), together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, automatically converted in accordance with its terms into shares of Common Stock of the Company, at a conversion price equal to $2.27 per share. The Parent Note, which was purchased by Parent in an aggregate principal amount of $30,000,000 on October 31, 2018, provided that it would convert into shares of Common Stock or the Company's 6.0% Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (&quot;Preferred Stock&quot;), as applicable, automatically upon the earlier of (i) the time that is immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger and (ii) the time that is immediately prior to consummation of a Superior Transaction (as defined in the Note Purchase and Exchange Agreement, dated as of October 31, 2018,</footnote>

At a conversion price of $2.27 per share, the Parent Note was converted into 13,240,089 shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Parent Note.</footnote>

        <footnote id="F10">Immediately following the contribution and assignment of the Rollover Shares to WC SACD and prior to the effective time of the Merger, WC SACD contributed and assigned the Rollover Shares to Parent.
