        <footnote id="F1">It was inadvertently reported on the original Form 4 filed October 23, 2018 that the Reporting Person indirectly owned 30,000 common units representing limited partners interests in Hi-Crush Partners LP (the &quot;Common Units&quot;) through his son, as further detailed in Footnote 2.  The Reporting Person indirectly owns 500 Common Units through his son, and this amendment is being filed as a correction.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">The Common Units included in this report were purchased by the Reporting Person's son for his own account in a Directed Unit Program in connection with the initial public offering of common units representing limited partner interests in the Issuer. The Reporting Person disclaims beneficial ownership of these securities, and this report shall not be deemed an admission that the reporting person is the beneficial owner of such securities for the purposes of Section 16 or for any other purpose.</footnote>
