Subsequently, the reporting person transferred 1,750 of those shares to his family trust, bringing the total number of shares indirectly held through his family trust to 24,137 shares. On June 20, 2018 and August 14, 2018, 1,100 and 1,000 of those shares, respectively, were sold, bringing the total number of shares indirectly held through his family trust to 22,037 shares, which is the current number of shares held indirectly by the reporting person through his family trust.
