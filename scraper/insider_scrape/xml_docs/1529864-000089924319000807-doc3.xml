        <footnote id="F5">The limited stock appreciation right (&quot;SAR&quot;) and employee stock option were granted in tandem. Accordingly, the exercise of one results in the expiration of the other. The SAR may be exercised only during the period beginning on the first day following the date that a &quot;Change in Control&quot; of Issuer occurs (as defined in the related grant agreement) and ending on the thirtieth day following such date. Upon exercise, the grantee shall be able to receive an amount equal to the product computed by multiplying (i) the excess of the &quot;Offer Value Per Share&quot; over the exercise price of the underlying option by (ii) the number of shares with respect to which the SAR is being exercised; provided, that such amount shall only be payable in the event an &quot;Offer&quot; is made.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F6">The &quot;Offer Value Per Share&quot; means the average selling price of Issuer's common stock during the period of 30 days ending on the date on which the SAR is exercised. &quot;Offer&quot; means any tender offer or exchange offer for outstanding shares of Enova representing at least 30% of the total voting power of the stock of Enova, or an offer to purchase assets from Enova that have a total gross fair market value equal to or more than 40% of the total gross fair market value of all of the assets of Enova, other than an offer made by Enova.</footnote>
