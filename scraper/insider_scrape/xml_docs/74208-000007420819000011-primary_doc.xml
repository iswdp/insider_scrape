        <footnote id="F1">Represents Class 2 LTIP Units in United Dominion Realty, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the &quot;UDR Partnership&quot;).  UDR, Inc. (the &quot;Company&quot;) is the parent company and sole general partner of the UDR Partnership.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Subject to the conditions set forth in the Tenth Amendment to the Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the UDR Partnership and subject to the vesting conditions specified with respect to each Class 2 LTIP Unit (as described in footnotes 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10, below), each Class 2 LTIP Unit may be converted, at the election of the holder, into a unit of limited partnership of the UDR Partnership (a &quot;Partnership Common Unit&quot;), provided that such Class 2 LTIP Unit has been outstanding for at least two years from the date of grant.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">A holder of Partnership Common Units has the right to require the UDR Partnership to redeem all or a portion of the Partnership Common Units held by the holder in exchange for a cash payment based on the market value of the Company's Common Stock at the time of redemption, as defined in the Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the UDR Partnership (the &quot;Cash Amount&quot;). However, the UDR Partnership's obligation to pay the Cash Amount is subject the prior right of the Company to acquire such Partnership Common Units in exchange for either the Cash Amount or shares of the Company's Common Stock, as described in footnote 4 below.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F4">The Company, as the general partner of the UDR Partnership, may, in its sole discretion, purchase the Partnership Common Units by paying the limited partner either the Cash Amount or the REIT Share Amount (generally one share of the Company's Common Stock for each Partnership Common Unit), as such terms are defined in the Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the UDR Partnership.  The right to convert the Class 2 LTIP Units into Partnership Common Units and the right to receive the Cash Amount or the REIT Share Amount (in the Company's sole discretion) in exchange for Partnership Common Units do not have expiration dates.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F5">The Class 2 LTIP Units will vest only to the extent that pre-established performance metrics are met for the applicable performance period, subject to continuing employment.  Except as otherwise set forth in the UDR, Inc. 1999 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended from time to time, except Section 14.9 thereof, the Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the UDR Partnership, or as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors (the &quot;Committee&quot;), in its sole discretion, vesting of the Class 2 LTIP shall cease upon the date of termination for any reason, and no unvested Class 2 LTIP units shall thereafter become vested.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F6">The vesting of these Class 2 LTIP Units shall be determined as follows: 35 percent shall be based on a goal measured by the Company's relative total shareholder return (&quot;TSR&quot;) as compared to an apartment peer group over a three-year cumulative performance period (the &quot;3-Year Relative Apartment Peer TSR Metric&quot;); 30 percent shall be based on the achievement of a pre-determined FFO as Adjusted goal over a one-year period (the &quot;1-Year FFO as Adjusted Metric&quot;); 20 percent shall be determined based on a goal measured by the Company's relative TSR as compared to a REIT peer group over a three-year cumulative performance period (the &quot;3-Year Relative REIT TSR Metric&quot;); and 15 percent shall be based on a goal measured by the Company's relative FFO as Adjusted growth rate as compared to an apartment peer group over a three-year cumulative performance period (the &quot;3-Year Relative FFO as Adjusted Metric&quot;).</footnote>
        <footnote id="F7">The portions of these Class 2 LTIP Units based upon the 3-Year Relative Apartment Peer TSR Metric, the 3-Year Relative REIT TSR Metric and the 3-Year Relative FFO as Adjusted Metric will vest upon certification of the results by the Committee in a period not to exceed 60 days from the conclusion of the performance period. The portion of the Class 2 LTIP Units based upon the 1-Year FFO as Adjusted Metric will vest 50 percent upon certification of results by the Committee in a period not to exceed 60 days from the conclusion of the performance period, and 50 percent one year thereafter.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F8">Amount represents the maximum award (including dividends) that could be earned under the plan, which is subject to forfeiture when the performance results are determined.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F9">The vesting of these Class 2 LTIP Units shall be determined as follows: 30 percent shall be based upon the Committee's subjective determination, in its sole discretion, of the executive officer's performance with respect to individual performance objectives; and 70 percent shall be based on the pre-determined financial metrics described in footnote 10 below. These Class 2 LTIP Units will vest upon a determination by the Committee occurring in a period not to exceed 60 days from the completion of the applicable performance period.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F10">The portion of these Class 2 LTIP Units that vest based upon the achievement of pre-determined financial metrics shall be determined as follows: 30 percent based on an FFO as Adjusted goal over a one-year period; 30 percent based on a transaction volume goal; 10 percent based on a controllable Operating NOI goal; 10 percent based on an operating platform execution goal; 10 percent based on a relative valuation goal; and 10 percent based on an associate engagement goal.</footnote>
