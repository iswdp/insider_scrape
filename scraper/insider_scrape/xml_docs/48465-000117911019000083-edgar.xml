        <footnote id="F1">Each share of phantom stock is the equivalent of one share of common stock.  The shares of phantom stock become payable in common stock in one lump sum, or in up to ten annual installments, at the election of the reporting person, on February 15 of the year following termination of service as a director, or such later date as is elected by the reporting person.  In addition, the shares of phantom stock become payable in common stock in one lump sum immediately upon a director's separation from service within six months following a change of control (as defined in the Plan).</footnote>
