Each RSU entitles the reporting person to receive one share of common stock upon vesting of the RSU. The RSUs will vest in three annual successive installment upon the completion of the reporting person's each year of service with the issuer for the three-year period measured from the date of grant, subject to accelerated vesting under certain prescribed circumstances.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Represents 3,703 shares of the issuer's common stock and 4,167 shares of the issuer's common stock underlying RSUs that will vest and become issuable in accordance with their terms.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">Represents 170 shares of common stock withheld by the issuer to satisfy the reporting person's tax withholding obligations with respect to an aggregate of 417 shares of common stock underlying RSUs that vested and became issuable on January 2, 2019 pursuant to the terms of the January 2, 2018 Restricted Stock Issuance Agreement between the issuer and the reporting person. The issuable shares were previously reported as Table I securities at the time the Restricted Stock Units were granted, and accordingly the issuance of those shares is not a reportable transaction on this Form 4.</footnote>
