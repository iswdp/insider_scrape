        <footnote id="F1">The Stock Units were granted pursuant to the deferred compensation agreements (the &quot;Deferred Compensation Agreements&quot;), dated December 18, 2009 and December 24, 2010, respectively, entered into between the reporting person and the Issuer. Each Stock Unit represents a contingent right to receive the value of one share of common stock of the Issuer.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Pursuant to the terms of the Deferred Compensation Agreements, the amount payable to the reporting person in settlement of the Stock Units was fixed on January 17, 2019 in connection with the reporting person's retirement as Executive Chairman of the Issuer and transition into the role of Chairman Emeritus based on the average of the closing prices of the Issuer's Common Stock for the ten consecutive trading days ending on January 16, 2019.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">Pursuant to the terms of the Deferred Compensation Agreements, vested Stock Units are to be settled in cash based on the value of the Issuer's Common Stock, calculated in accordance with the terms of the Deferred Compensation Agreements, on the earlier of the termination of the reporting person's employment or the effective date of a Change-in-Control (as defined in the Deferred Compensation Agreements).</footnote>
