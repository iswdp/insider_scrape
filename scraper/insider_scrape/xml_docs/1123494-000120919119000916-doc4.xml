        <footnote id="F1">Represents a deferred stock award of 14,000 restricted stock units which vest quarterly in equal installments on March 31, 2019, June 30, 2019, September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2019, and are subject to continued service as a non-employee director on the applicable vesting dates. These retainer awards are granted in satisfaction of the annual retainer compensation to be earned by the director for his service on the Issuer's Board of Directors and its Committees during 2019. The number of shares of common stock subject to such retainer award is equal to the amount of cash that would have been received had the retainers all been paid in cash, divided by the average daily closing market price of the Issuer's common stock for the month of November, rounded to the nearest 100 shares.</footnote>
