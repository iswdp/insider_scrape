        <footnote id="F1">Grant of stock under the Issuer's 2011 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended, in connection with the Reporting Person's services as a Director.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">The aggregate value of the annual equity award to each director in 2018-2019 was set at $220,000, with one quarter, or $55,000, to be granted on the first day of each quarter, based on the closing price of the Issuer's common stock on such day. Since the grant date of January 1, 2019 was a non-trading day, the number of shares was calculated based on the closing price of the Issuer's common stock on December 31, 2018, of $116.22. Thus, the grant this quarter for services as a Director is for 473 shares of the Issuer's common stock.</footnote>
