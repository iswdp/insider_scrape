        <footnote id="F1">The reporting person participates in the MGIC Investment Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan (the &quot;Plan&quot;) for Non-Employee Directors under which units corresponding to shares of common stock of the Issuer (&quot;Share Units&quot;) are acquired by the reporting person through, among other ways, compensation deferral.  Dividends which would have been received on shares represented by the Share Units are also invested in Share Units.  The Share Units will be settled in cash, on the first business day of the calendar month following the Distribution Date (as defined in the Plan).</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">These Share Units do not have a specified dollar-denominated exercise or conversion price.  (Their value is based, on as one-for-one basis, on the price of the Issuer's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange.)</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">These Share Units are acquired through compensation deferral.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F4">These Share Units do not become exercisable on a fixed date or expire.  (Generally, the Share Units become payable at the time the reporting person ceases to be a Director of the Issuer.)</footnote>
