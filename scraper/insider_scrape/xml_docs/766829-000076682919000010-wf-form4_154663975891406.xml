The RSUs will vest in three annual successive installments upon the completion of the reporting person's each year of services with the issuer for the three-year period measured from the date of grant, subject to accelerated vesting under certain prescribed circumstances.</footnote>

The issuable shares were previously reported as Table I securities at the time the restricted stock units were granted, and accordingly the issuance of those shares is not a reportable transaction on this Form 4.</footnote>
