        <footnote id="F1">The Deferred Stock Units (&quot;DSUs&quot;) were granted in lieu of the reporting person's 2019 first quarter cash retainer. The DSUs equal the reporting person's quarterly retainer fee divided by the January 2, 2019 closing price of the issuer's common stock. Each DSU represents the issuer's obligation to transfer one share of Class A common stock, $0.01 par value per share (&quot;Common Stock&quot;), in accordance with the terms of the deferred stock unit agreement pursuant to which the DSUs were granted. The DSUs were granted under the issuer's Non-Employee Director Equity Plan and are immediately vested upon grant. Promptly following termination of the reporting person's service on the issuer's Board of Directors or at the reporting person's election of a specified distribution date, the issuer will distribute to the reporting person shares of Common Stock equal to the number of DSUs reflected in the reporting person's account at such time.</footnote>
