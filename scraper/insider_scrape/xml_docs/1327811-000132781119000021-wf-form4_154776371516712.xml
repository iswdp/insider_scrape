These sales are mandated by the Issuer's election under its equity incentive plans to require the satisfaction of a tax withholding obligation to be funded by a &quot;sell to cover&quot; transaction and do not represent discretionary trades by the Reporting Person.</footnote>

The Reporting Person undertakes to provide to Workday, Inc., any security holder of Workday, Inc., or the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission, upon request, full information regarding the number of shares sold at each separate price within the range(s) set forth in this footnote of this Form 4.</footnote>
