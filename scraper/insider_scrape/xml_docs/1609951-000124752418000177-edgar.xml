    <remarks>Although the reporting person was previously deemed to be an &quot;officer&quot; for purposes of Section 16 in his capacity as Birmingham Market President of the issuer's subsidiary bank, National Bank of Commerce (&quot;NBC&quot;), the Issuer's board of directors determined, at a meeting on March 21, 2017, that the reporting person should no longer be deemed a Section 16 &quot;officer.&quot;  However, in connection with his appointment to the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer of the Issuer and NBC on August 28, 2018, the reporting person once again became a Section 16 &quot;officer&quot; of the Issuer.  Because the reporting person had previously been a Section 16 filer, an additional Form 3 was inadvertently not filed at that time.  Note that, between March 21, 2017 and August 28, 2018, had the reporting person been subject to Section 16 reporting, only two transactions would have been reported: (1) the disposition on January 30, 2018 of 5,000 shares of the Issuer's common stock at $44.60 and (2) the acquisition of 2,119.20 phantom stock units acquired through participation in the Issuer's Deferral of Compensation Plan for Key Employees and Non-Employee Directors on March 9, 2018 in connection with the deferral of the amount due to the reporting person upon settlement of a performance share award originally granted to the reporting person as of January 1, 2014 pursuant to the Issuer's 2011 Equity Incentive Plan. Since August 28, 2018, there have been no reportable transactions in the Issuer's common stock involving the reporting person.</remarks>
