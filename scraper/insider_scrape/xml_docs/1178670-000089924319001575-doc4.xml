    <remarks>The reporting person owns 10,554,134 shares of common stock of ALNY indirectly through its subsidiary, Genzyme Corp. On January 14, 2019, ALNY conducted an underwritten public offering of 5,000,000 shares of its common stock (the &quot;Offering&quot;). The Offering closed on or about January 17, 2019. As a result of the Offering, the reporting person's ownership interest in ALNY decreased below 10% solely by virtue of the increase in the total number of shares of common stock of ALNY outstanding subsequent to the Offering. As a result, the reporting person is no longer subject to Section 16 in connection with its transactions in the equity securities of ALNY and therefore will no longer report any such transactions on Form 4 or Form 5.</remarks>
